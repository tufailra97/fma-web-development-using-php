Page 1 of 3
Web Programming using PHP (P1)
Final Marked Assignment (FMA)
## Introduction
The FMA, which carries 75% of the total marks for this module, requires you to use your
knowledge of PHP, form validation and file manipulation to create a prototype web site, which
models user registration and log-in system for access to a simple website and password
protected intranet pages for the department of Computer Science at Birkbeck College.
The completed FMA deliverables should be submitted electronically in the Assignment
Dropbox in Moodle BEFORE the appropriate submission deadline for your class.
Completing the FMA
You should work on your FMA both during and after class. Begin your work early, as the FMA
is a substantial task that requires much planning and effort to complete satisfactorily.
## Getting support
You may email your tutor up to 2 weeks before the FMA deadline with any queries you may
have on your FMA. You can request feedback on your work by email. You only have one
opportunity for feedback.
## FMA Specifications
Your Task
The Department of Computer Science (DCS) at Birkbeck College, have requested that you
develop a prototype main page and link this page to prototype secure intranet pages. Your
system should include the following aspects:
1. Main index page, which should provide some dummy content, as an introduction to
DCS, plus the following links:
i. Intranet: links to a secure page which provides access to module results via a
login
ii. Administrator: links to a registration page/form via admin password, which if
successful, allows an administrator to set up new members of staff.
2. Log-in: A member of staff should be able to log-in to the intranet by entering a valid
username and password in a form.
3. Log-out: A logged in member of staff will be able to log-out of the system from any
page, and a message will be displayed to this effect returning the user to the index
page.
4. Admin page: A page for an administrator to register a new member of staff to allow
them to login to the intranet. The data required for a member of staff to be registered
as a user is:
a. Title
b. First name
c. Surname
d. Email
e. Username
f. Password (The administrator password should be “DCSadmin01”).
5. Secure intranet content pages: An intranet index page which links to 3 module
results pages (data provided in the FMA resources folder in Moodle). These three
pages should show module results for the following modules:
a. Web Programming using PHP - P1 Results
b. Introduction to Database Technology – DT Results
Page 2 of 3
c. Problem Solving for Programming – PfP Results
6. The user should be able to browse between pages while maintaining their logged-in or
out state, regardless of their browser settings. N.B. the module results pages should
only be accessible if a member of staff has successfully logged in (including the
administrator user), otherwise only the index page should be available.
7. All pages should display a link or form to log-in or out depending on the current user
status. If the user is logged in, the page should display the username of the logged in
user and if a user logs out they should be redirected to the index page.
A user navigating to any of the public content pages should be able to view the content
directly whether they are logged-in or logged-out. The pages should clearly display their user
status (apart from the URL links to https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/... pages). If a logged out user
tries to access the intranet pages, they should be politely requested to log-in.
There is no specific requirement to apply any CSS or other formatting to your html
output, however, you may do so, if you feel that it adds to the presentation of your solution.
However, the output should use htmlentities and validate correctly under the DOCTYPE you
have specified.
